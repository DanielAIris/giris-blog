# Comparison of CoT with Vector Database RAG vs Chain of Task with Graph Database

Have you implemented a RAG with a vector database and encountered challenges with complex searches?

## How does it work?

- Vector-based RAG performs matching, not reasoning.
- Chain of Thought (CoT), which appears a priori to be the most advanced reasoning technique for LLMs, reasons implicitly without guaranteeing 100% accuracy.
- There is a simpler alternative: structuring, classifying, and querying efficiently using a graph database.

Let's explore how to implement a RAG with 100% accuracy using chain of task.

## 1. Why most vector database RAGs fail in production

Implementing a RAG on a vector database seems appealing: you chunk your document base, vectorize, query… and it works in initial tests. However, scaling often fails. Why?

### IVFFlat (FAISS, ChromaDB, Qdrant):
- Incorrect nlist (number of clusters) → poorly distinguished clusters.
- Incorrect nprobe (number of clusters queried) → partial coverage of the top-k.
- Result: loss of recall.

### HNSW (ChromaDB, Weaviate, Pinecone, Qdrant):
- Optimized for speed but sensitive to the limitations of vector geometry.
- Geometric proximity does not guarantee true semantic relevance.
- Result: false positives, confusion between closely related concepts.

### Post hoc reranker:
- The reranker is often used to improve the quality of the top-k after vector search. However, it frequently encounters an issue related to cluster overlaps:
  - Multiple embeddings that are very close but belong to different clusters end up in the initial top-k.
  - The reranker must then distinguish between these results, but it can be misled by these overlaps and select a false positive as the most relevant.
- We illustrated this issue through a visualization showing how overlap zones bias reranking and top-k selection.
- Result: increased cost, higher latency, and degraded top-k relevance despite the reranking effort.

## 2. CoT with Vector RAG

Chain of Thought (CoT) involves asking the LLM to detail its reasoning step by step, rather than responding directly. This offers several advantages:
- The model structures its response into logical steps.
- It improves human understanding of the reasoning process.
- It can reduce errors by enforcing intermediate verification.

However, in a vector RAG, CoT is limited by several factors:
- The LLM's reasoning relies entirely on the documents retrieved in the top-k.
  - If the retrieved documents are noisy or irrelevant, CoT reasons from flawed foundations.
- The model does not question the relevance of the provided documents.
  - CoT blindly trusts the retrieved documents.
- The content injected into the prompt (retrieved context) remains static, even if the model detects contradictions or missing information.
- The cost is multiplied: First, by the vector search and reranking. Then, by the step-by-step reasoning, which increases the number of generated tokens, thus raising latency and costs.

### In summary:
- CoT does not compensate for the limitations of vector search.
- It improves presentation but not quality if the top-k is already biased.
- You get more readable reasoning, but not necessarily more accurate.

## 3. The Alternative: Chain of Task with Classification and Graph

Instead of delegating reasoning to the model, you structure the reasoning once and for all. Chain of task operates through multiple inferences, thus in multiple steps, unlike CoT, which breaks down the prompt into multiple reasoning stages.

### Step 1 - Preliminary Prompt Classification
Upon receiving the prompt, you:
- Assign business-relevant labels (intent, domain, context, constraints, temporality, etc.).
- Dynamically select appropriate nodes in the graph, each node containing a chunk (the more labeled a node, the greater the granularity and specificity).
- The labels are organized hierarchically with a multi-level taxonomy to better structure the information.
- Even a naive classification suffices if your graph is well-structured.
- Result: Zero noise, 100% accuracy, no unnecessary computations.

### Step 2 - Controlled Retrieval
You control what to query, how to connect, and what to return.  
Example:
- Prompt: "What are the critical thresholds for an electrical blackout in France?"
- Classification: Critical threshold, Rapid balancing capacity, Interconnections with neighboring countries, Current network load, Adjustment delay, Absence of black-start, Risk of desynchronization, SCADA vulnerability, Critical frequency range, Climate sensitivity.
- How to perform this classification?
  - Use BART, ModernBERT, or Qwen3 0.6, either with fine-tuning (LoRA) or prompt-tuning.

### Step 3 - Retrieval of Chunks
Retrieval:
- Direct query on the labels.
- Navigation of relationships (interconnections, reserves, climate).
- Specific chunks are retrieved. If calculations are needed, a specific fine-tuning is recommended.
- Otherwise, complex reasoning is broken down into small, simple, fast, and efficient tasks.

### How to Build the Graph - Ontology and Taxonomy
The graph structures:
- The chunks (nodes).
- The labels (node metadata), which are hierarchical.
- Business relationships (edges).
- The clusters.

You query the graph directly:
- Through label-based queries (GraphQL, DQL, Cypher).
- Or via lightweight algorithms (Jaccard, SimRank).
- No need for an expensive reranker or CoT.

## 4. Why This Approach Is More Robust and Simpler

- The graph manages complexity through relationships, not via an approximate similarity score.
- Classification reduces the search space to what is relevant.
- Retrieval is controlled, explicit, and verifiable.

### Result:
- ✅ 100% accuracy achievable*, even with a small 7–8B model.
- ✅ Controlled cost.
- ✅ Predictable behavior.

*100% accuracy depends on the initial quality of the structuring (ontology/taxonomy), the coverage of labels, and the updates to your graph.

### CoT with VectorDB Remains Relevant For:
- Domains with low prior structuring.
- Creative and exploratory search.
- Generic multi-domain systems.
- Contexts requiring rapid adaptation.
- Projects with resource constraints.

## Conclusion

Chain of Task breaks down processing into explicit and controlled tasks, while Chain of Thoughts decomposes reasoning within the generation itself, which remains costly and less controllable. Better yet, while multi-indexing creates cluster overlaps and biases retrieval, multi-labeling in the graph increases granularity and improves accuracy.
