Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing businesses at an unprecedented pace. But how do you go from an idea to a fully operational AI project? This article outlines the two essential phases for successfully executing an AI project: <strong>exploration</strong> and <strong>production</strong>. Whether you're a startup or a large enterprise, discover the steps, strategic choices, and associated costs to maximize your chances of success.

  <h2>Phase 1: Exploration – Validating the idea with a POC</h2>

  <h3>The challenge: Identifying the need</h3>
Every AI project begins with a question: what problem are you trying to solve? Whether it’s a business need (e.g., process optimization, data analysis) or a strategic vision from leadership, the exploration phase aims to test feasibility with a <strong>limited budget</strong>.

  <h3>The solution: A rapid Proof of Concept (POC)</h3>
To validate your idea, the most effective approach is to <strong>leverage existing AI models via API connections</strong>. Using <strong>prompt engineering</strong>, you can build a prototype in <strong>about a week</strong>. This method allows for quick prototyping without significant resource investment.

  <h3>Why is it useful?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Internal Validation</strong>: A POC convinces stakeholders and secures budget approval for the next steps.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Testing</strong>: It confirms the solution meets end-user needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Affordable Cost</strong>: Expect to spend around <strong>€100</strong>, primarily for API access.</li>
    </ul>
<strong>Recommendation</strong>: This approach is ideal for a POC but unsuitable for large-scale production.

  <h2>Phase 2: Production – Scaling up</h2>
Once the POC is validated, it’s time to deploy the solution in a real-world environment. This involves <strong>integrating the AI with internal data and existing tools</strong>. Two options are available: continue with an existing API (Option A) or develop a <strong>proprietary AI</strong> (Option B).

  <h3>Option A: Continuing with an API</h3>
    <h4>The challenge</h4>
Using an API is often faster and less expensive but comes with limitations:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Limited Scalability</strong>: APIs restrict full control over the model’s architecture.</li>
        <li><strong>Complex Business Relationships</strong>: For sophisticated use cases, a standard database (RAG with documents) is insufficient. Interdependent entity relationships require a <strong>graph</strong> for native connectivity.</li>
        <li><strong>Fine-Tuning Required</strong>: Without precise model adjustments, performance may plateau.</li>
    </ul>

  <h4>The solution</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>RAG with Document Database</strong>: A solid starting point for integrating internal data.</li>
        <li><strong>Switch to GraphRAG</strong>: For complex relationships, a graph is necessary. However, GraphRAG via API achieves only <strong>10% of the capabilities</strong> of a proprietary model due to restricted access to model parameters.</li>
    </ul>

  <h4>Cost</h4>
Expect <strong>less than €50,000</strong> for an API-based solution, including development and fine-tuning.

  <h4>Limitations</h4>
This option is attractive for its cost but compromises on confidentiality, security, and scalability for strategic projects.

  <h3>Option B: Developing a proprietary AI</h3>
    <h4>The challenge</h4>
Building a proprietary AI requires more resources but is a strategic investment for companies aiming to stand out.

  <h4>Why choose a proprietary AI?</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Intellectual Property</strong>: You become a key player in your industry by owning unique technology.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Confidentiality</strong>: Your data remains secure without reliance on external providers.</li>
        <li><strong>Full Control</strong>: You manage the architecture and workflow, critical for complex training strategies.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Security</strong>: The model is hosted <strong>on-premise</strong> (on your servers).</li>
        <li><strong>Team Upskilling</strong>: Your teams gain expertise through transitional management.</li>
    </ol>

  <h4>The solution</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>RAG with Graph and Fine-Tuning</strong>: This approach combines a graph database to model complex relationships and fine-tuning to tailor the model to your specific needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Custom Architecture</strong>: Every project is unique. Expert design is critical for a tailored architecture. For instance, companies like Giris don’t charge for architecture design, reducing costs while delivering rare expertise.</li>
    </ul>

  <h4>Cost</h4>
Anticipate an investment <strong>exceeding €50,000</strong>, depending on project complexity.

  <h4>Why it’s worth it</h4>
A proprietary AI positions your company as an innovative leader while ensuring security, scalability, and performance. It’s especially recommended for strategic or sensitive projects.

  <h2>RAG, Graph, Fine-tuning: When to use them?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)</strong>: Ideal for integrating internal data but limited for complex relationships.</li>
        <li><strong>Graph</strong>: Essential for modeling interdependencies (e.g., client-supplier networks, logistics). Native graphs are far more powerful in proprietary AI.</li>
        <li><strong>Fine-tuning</strong>: Recommended in nearly all cases to optimize model performance for your use case.</li>
    </ul>

<em>Note</em>: The choice between RAG and fine-tuning depends on your use case. A dedicated article will follow to clarify this further.

  <h2>Tips for a successful AI project</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Start small</strong>: A quick, low-cost POC lets you test without risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Think strategically</strong>: A proprietary AI is a competitive advantage for differentiation and data security.</li>
        <li><strong>Choose the right partners</strong>: Expertise in AI architecture is rare. Prioritize partners offering tailored solutions at reasonable costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Train your teams</strong>: An AI project is an opportunity to build internal expertise.</li>
    </ol>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
Launching an AI project may seem daunting, but by following these two phases—<strong>rapid exploration with a POC</strong> and <strong>thoughtful production with a tailored AI</strong>—you can maximize your success. Whether you opt for an API or a proprietary AI, align your strategy with your business goals and resources. With a structured approach and the right tools, AI can transform your business today.
<em>Good luck on your AI journey!</em>
