Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing businesses at an unprecedented pace. But how do you go from an idea to a fully operational AI project? This article outlines the two essential phases for successfully executing an AI project: exploration and production. Whether you’re a startup or a large enterprise, discover the steps, strategic choices, and associated costs to maximize your chances of success.

Phase 1: Exploration — Validating the idea with a POC
The challenge: Identifying the need
Every AI project begins with a question: what problem are you trying to solve? Whether it’s a business need (e.g., process optimization, data analysis) or a strategic vision from leadership, the exploration phase aims to test feasibility with a limited budget.

The solution: A rapid Proof of Concept (POC)
To validate your idea, the most effective approach is to leverage existing AI models via API connections. Using prompt engineering, you can build a prototype in about a week. This method allows for quick prototyping without significant resource investment.

Why is it useful?
Internal validation: A POC convinces stakeholders and secures budget approval for the next steps.
Business testing: It confirms the solution meets end-user needs.
Affordable cost: Expect to spend around €100, primarily for API access.
Recommendation: This approach is ideal for a POC but unsuitable for large-scale production.

Phase 2: Production — Scaling up
Once the POC is validated, it’s time to deploy the solution in a real-world environment. This involves integrating the AI with internal data and existing tools. Two options are available: continue with an existing API (Option A) or develop a proprietary AI (Option B).

Option A: Continuing with an API
The challenge
Using an API is often faster and less expensive but comes with limitations:

Limited scalability: APIs restrict full control over the model’s architecture.
Complex business relationships: For sophisticated use cases, a standard database (RAG with documents) is insufficient. Interdependent entity relationships require a graph for native connectivity.
Fine-Tuning Required: Without precise model adjustments, performance may plateau.
The solution
RAG with document database: A solid starting point for integrating internal data.
Switch to GraphRAG: For complex relationships, a graph is necessary. However, GraphRAG via API achieves only 10% of the capabilities of a proprietary model due to restricted access to model parameters.
Cost
Expect less than €50,000 for an API-based solution, including development and fine-tuning.

Limitations
This option is attractive for its cost but compromises on confidentiality, security, and scalability for strategic projects.

Option B: Developing a proprietary AI
The challenge
Building a proprietary AI requires more resources but is a strategic investment for companies aiming to stand out.

Why choose a proprietary AI?
Intellectual property: You become a key player in your industry by owning unique technology.
Data confidentiality: Your data remains secure without reliance on external providers.
Full control: You manage the architecture and workflow, critical for complex training strategies.
Enhanced security: The model is hosted on-premise (on your servers).
Team upskilling: Your teams gain expertise through transitional management.
The solution
RAG with Graph and Fine-Tuning: This approach combines a graph database to model complex relationships and fine-tuning to tailor the model to your specific needs.
Custom architecture: Every project is unique. Expert design is critical for a tailored architecture. For instance, companies like Giris don’t charge for architecture design, reducing costs while delivering rare expertise.
Cost
Anticipate an investment exceeding €50,000, depending on project complexity.

Why it’s worth it
A proprietary AI positions your company as an innovative leader while ensuring security, scalability, and performance. It’s especially recommended for strategic or sensitive projects.

RAG, Graph, fine-tuning: When to use them?
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Ideal for integrating internal data but limited for complex relationships.
Graph: Essential for modeling interdependencies (e.g., client-supplier networks, logistics). Native graphs are far more powerful in proprietary AI.
Fine-tuning: Recommended in nearly all cases to optimize model performance for your use case.
Note: The choice between RAG and fine-tuning depends on your use case. A dedicated article will follow to clarify this further.

Tips for a successful AI project
Start small: A quick, low-cost POC lets you test without risk.
Think strategically: A proprietary AI is a competitive advantage for differentiation and data security.
Choose the right partners: Expertise in AI architecture is rare. Prioritize partners offering tailored solutions at reasonable costs.
Train your teams: An AI project is an opportunity to build internal expertise.
Conclusion
Launching an AI project may seem daunting, but by following these two phases — rapid exploration with a POC and thoughtful production with a tailored AI — you can maximize your success. Whether you opt for an API or a proprietary AI, align your strategy with your business goals and resources. With a structured approach and the right tools, AI can transform your business today.

Good luck on your AI journey!
